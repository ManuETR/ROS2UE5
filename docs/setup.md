# ROS2UE5 Plugin Setup Guid
This guid is a step by step instruction on how to setup ROS2 and Unreal Engine 5.3.

Im the example the plugin is then used to simulate the kinematics of the r6not.

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 20.04 or later; Windows with WSL (preferred*)
- ROS 2 Humble
- Unreal Engine 5

*Windows with WSL is currently the preferred setup as Unreal Engine 5 is running smoother on windows than it does on Linux.

I therefor suggest to install UE5 directly on Windows and install ROS2 and its packages within WSL Ubuntu.

## Setup

### Install Unreal Engine
#### Windows (preferred)
1. Download and install the Epic Game Launcher `https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download`
2. Inside the Epic Games Launcher go to "Unreal Engine">"Library"
3. Next to "Engine versions" click add, select 5.3.x as version and hit install
4. To launch Unreal Engine either start it with its link created during the install or launch it within the Epic Games Launcher

#### Linux
1. Download "Unreal Engine for Linux" from `https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/linux` - make sure to download "Linux_Unreal_Engine_5.3.x.zip"
